Cryptography:  
*Note: Every cipher file must have be able to import functions from helpfulFunction.py"

- Helpful Functions:
  - text_clean(text, LETTERS):
    - text is the phrase being cleaned
    - LETTERS is the alphabet used to see if the letters in text are valid
    - By default, LETTERS is every letter in the alphabet
